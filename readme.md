# Bot Control Panel

This project is a web-based control panel for managing a Selenium bot in headless mode, designed to automate gameplay in a browser-based pokemon game. It is deployed on AWS, utilizing services such as EC2 for hosting, RDS for database management, and potentially S3 for static file storage in the future.
